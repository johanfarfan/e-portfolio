                <h4>ENG 1010</h4>
                <p>English 1010 is probably the biggest challenge for fall 2017 semester, Spanish is my mother language and <b>English</b> is 
                my second one, in order to advance successfully in the US I need to master my English skills.</p>
                <p>I always enjoyed thinking and writing essays in Spanish, abut any theme that can come to my mind, not too often, but 
                certainly I've done it before, even though I've experience writing corporate emails in English, my resources were not close 
                to what I was able to work up in my first language, most of those writings didn't include any emotion or poetry.</p>
                <p>I'm expecting that through my studies in this course I will be capable of doing what I can do in Spanish, I know I 
                will and it’s going to be a joy, it’s a blessing to have the power to communicate and be you in more than one idiom.</p>
                
                <div class="bg-light">
                    <h4 class="text-right">BUS 1010</h4>
                    <p><b>Business</b> isn't involved in my major, it isn't required to get my certificates but I choose it as one of my electives because 
                    this kind of knowledge is vital for me, I'm excited to expand my abilities on this area as I ever wanted to have my own small 
                    business.</p>
                    <p>Business is not just about knowing the market on the field you want to work in, it can be really interesting and complicated, 
                    there are many variants involved on it, there are many aspects to study just to get started, to keep on the market, and to 
                    make a company grow healthy. </p>

                <h4>CSIS 1200</h4>
                <p><b>The Introduction to Networking</b> class is highly important to obtain some basic knowledge about connections, no matter what kind
                of CSIS specialization you are aiming for.</p>
                <p>Theory and practice are mixed together in Intro to Networking, to understand the 
                many ways how a computer, a cell phone, a server, or even your Tesla car can be interconnected with other devices, and 
                security isn't excluded from this, so even being a "introductory" class it's loaded with plenty of worth material for my 
                major.</p>

                    <p>As I'm planning to get certificates in Web design and Programming, <b>SQL Programming</b> will allow me to learn the basics for my 
                    future online databases required for many apps and programs, without SQL probably many companies wouldn't be able to have 
                    administrative servers sharing the same information for several branches, or it couldn't be possible for Facebook to save the 
                    pictures that we want to share with family and friends. SQL Programming is a not so complicated and fun course that I am sure 
                    I will enjoy.</p>

                <h4>ART 1050</h4>
                <p>As I mention in the “Hobbies and Interests” section of my site, Art is something that I enjoy. Is one of 
                the most interesting manifestations of the human beings, because even if is not biologically required to live, 
                the mankind doesn’t stop making any kind of art.</p>
                <p><b>Photography</b> wasn’t something that I wanted to try since too long ago, I was more into painting, I suddenly had 
                the curiosity to try it and learn it and I don’t regret it!</p>
                <p>A wonderful fun class where I learned so many techniques and secrets, it was harder than I thought it’d be,  and 
                way more complex. At the end it’s just satisfying to see all the progress I made, and now it’s part of my hobbies.</p>

                <h4>CSIS 1430</h4>
                <p></p>I had so much fun learning HTML, CSS and JS 2018's Spring semester. Many of these assignments were challenging, All 
                the enjoyment that I had might be because this subject might end up becoming my career, Web Programming in general involves 
                not just programming but design, there should be harmony in the look and functionality of the web page.</p>
                <p>Whit every new thing you learn you can go back and improve what you already have, trying to make that script 
                work flawlessly, error proof. Whit every page you make the next one will look better, after all it's a double 
                exercise; optimizing the look and feel of the site and it's responsiveness. It's always possible to optimize those 
                first code lines you do when you're a beginner.</p>
                <p>I can just say it was a great experience that motivates me to go for more knowledge, and a big satisfaction after-work.</p>

                    <p></p>Who doesn’t love free stuff? I love free software. <b>Linux</b> has always been present in my desktops and laptops either 
                    Fedora or Ubuntu they are always alongside Windows for me to experiment and ‘play’ whit them.</p>
                    <p>In a serious fashion, Linux is important and abundant in the internet world, many people don’t have any idea 
                    about this fact. As a future Web Programmer I’ll need some serious knowledge of Linux in it’s hardest 
                    presentation, the non-graphical version.</p>
                    <p>I already have the user experience with the graphical environment, now I just started to learn the administrative 
                    non-graphical side, just because.. I Like Linux, and I need to know how to set up a web server like the +80% of 
                    the servers that are currently running out there, a Linux server.</p>

                <p>Happiness, why happiness? It is something that we always look for even without knowing, it’s been theorized as the main deepest motive why we do things for, the final explanation of our general behavior. Happiness, or the good living is something we all look for but not in the same way. some philosophers and religions have traced the path to reach it according to their believes, and still in modern days we are still studying the good life through science like psychology, like an obsession to know what really makes us happy and the best ways to have a good life.</p>

                <p><strong>Project: VW emissions case</strong></p>
                <p>This analysis of the VW case will give a brief history of how the problem started, implicitly evaluating the company’s values and leaving open questions about their personal motives but showing their interests and ambitions. Something that cannot be left out are the consequences of such actions that generated a mistrust on the company, and environmental consequences due to the illegal actions taken by them. It’s hard to measure the damage caused by VW, the pollution added to the air, but the consequences on everybody's health can and will be explained.</p>
