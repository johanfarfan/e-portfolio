            <h1>Arts and Craftings</h1>
            <p>Since I was a kid I've always enjoyed <strong>drawing</strong>, create things with my own hands, I was interested in 
            everything related with <em>sculpting, classical paintings and old Roman, Greek and Japanese architecture</em>. We had a collection 
            of atlas, world book encyclopedias and references, at home and they were guilty of my interest about culture and arts.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-6"><img class="w-75 m-1" src="./img/p1.JPG"></div>
                    <div class="col-md-6"><img class="w-75 m-1" src="./img/p2.JPG"></div>

            <p class="text-center"><small>My latest hobby after I took ART 1050, Photography</small></p>
            <br><br>
            <p>My father used to work in a wood distributor company, and I used to collect some of the chopped wood sticks and any other wood 
            residual to practice some amateur <strong>carpentry</strong> at home.</p>
            <p>After my adolescence I was more interested in drawing and hand crafting using recycled materials. My drawings were mostly based on pop culture 
            characters, and few others were about historical places or amateur reproductions of landscapes</p>
            <p>My last drawings were about Caribbean beaches. Before I moved to the US, I drew two of my best friends and I gave them the drawings.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Physical Activities</h1>
            <p>I am not really a gym person. Outdoor activities are more interesting and fun for me, walking/running, rollerblading, and sometimes, work with my 
            own weight. I hope to start practicing Yoga soon.</p>
            <p>Martial Arts were my default hobby and training when I was younger</p>
            <p> Walking allows me to relax after a stressful day of work, or any non-comfortable situation, nights are better for me 
            to do it. When I do it I can think about me, my life, actual topics, world's issues, etc.</p>
            <p> If I feel more "energic", skating would be the activity for me, Inline skating. I have never being a pro and it is not 
            my intention to be, inline skating or rollerblading gives me that sensation of freedom that we all sometimes need. Jumping, 
            grinding, falling, or the simple fact of slide through the streets just for my own satisfaction.</p>
            <p> Back in my country, swimming was another option. Now that I am living in Utah I guess I just have to get more 
            comfortable with the cold water, form someone who was born and raised in a tropical coast at the Caribbean even the Summers 
            in the USA the water is extremely cold, so it is hard to relax for me, I hope I will make it.</p>
