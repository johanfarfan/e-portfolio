                <p>Either when a work is done for a client or for self interest and benefit, applications are implemented to solve needs.</p>
                <p>Exploring in deep those needs is the first step to start a project. After all, if the application is implemented and no solution was delivered the whole project was a waste of time.</p>

                        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/hierarchy.png" class="mb-2" alt="picture of a dependance diagram"></div>
                        <p class="lead">Listing all the possible features the Web Site will have will help to make sure that the client is going to have all the required functionality.</p>
                        <p>It does not hurt to explore or suggest to the client if additional modules would be considered useful to their needs.</p>
                        <p>Website purpose might vary depending on the client's target, Sales, Donations, Volunteering and Services are the most common ones. Yet it is necessary to create an attractive, engaging website so users would be loyal and attract other potential users.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Even if they are flexible, due dates are a vital part of the agreements.</p>
                        <p>If the client is in a rush to have the website online and there are a lot of features to work on, scheduled modules can be added according to their priority.</p>
                        <p>Economics of human resources -how many geeks we have in our team- are our heavier factor for due dates, so it's also good to keep them in mind. Don't forget about another running projects you may have.</p>

                    </div>
                <p>After having known all the requirements and before starting to work in anything, the next step is to divide programming and design into modules. For long projects sub divide the longest more complex tasks.</p>
                <p>Prioritize the development of each module, the smaller your team is, the more important prioritization becomes</p>
                <p><strong><span class="text-primary">Soloing a extensive project?</span></strong> Sometimes even if we are full stack developers doesn't means we can manage it all in a tight period of time. Looking for someone who can take care of a part of the project makes a huge difference.</p>
                <p>On the other hand if our experience isn't adequate for one of the features that our client required, Looking for a remote collaborator is not a bad idea. There are several online directories where you can find web programmers with any kind of specialization, they will happily work for the right share according to their availability.</p>

                <p>Productivity software is usually overlooked. For small / micro projects some time management software may be too much, but when working in a team for a big project there are several advantages of using them.</p>
                <p>Some other related software for IT professionals have become so important that they are not an option anymore, they are just needed.</p>
                <p>Here are some examples of useful apps for professionals</p>

                        <p class="bg-light">Git has become so important that for the most IT related companies it's use is mandatory. It was designed specially for developers so the code can be shared, modified, by several users even if they are using it at the same time. It basically track changes in your code and it's used for version control.</p>

                        <p class="bg-light">Time tracking apps like Harvest have several uses. Although it's main use seems to be for analytical data, knowing what is taking most of the time, if everyone has been having the same workload and other details of our team's productivity is an amazing managerial tool.</p>
