                    <h2>Flying mammals</h2>
                    <p>The second largest order of mammals, bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species 
                    worldwide, with over 1,200 species. These were traditionally divided into two suborders: the 
                    largely fruit-eating megabats, and the echolocating microbats. But more recent evidence has 
                    supported dividing the order into Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, with megabats as members 
                    of the former along with several species of microbats. Many bats are insectivores, and most of 
                    the rest are frugivores (fruit-eaters). A few species feed on animals other than insects.</p>

                <div class="subcontainer1-2"><p>Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera; with their forelimbs adapted as wings, 
                    they are the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight. 
                    Bats are more manoeuvrable than birds, flying with their very long spread-out 
                    digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium. The smallest bat, and arguably 
                    the smallest extant mammal, is Kitti's hog-nosed bat, which is 29–34 mm (1.14–1.34 in) 
                    in length, 15 cm (5.91 in) across the wings and 2–2.6 g (0.07–0.09 oz) in mass. 
                    The largest bats are the flying foxes and the giant golden-crowned flying fox, Acerodon 
                    jubatus, which can weigh 1.6 kg (4 lb) and have a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in).</p></div>

                    <p>70% of bats consume insects, sharing a large part of natural pest control. There are also fruit-eating bats; 
                        nectar-eating bats; carnivorous bats that prey on small mammals, birds, lizards and frogs; fish-eating bats, 
                        and perhaps most famously, the blood-sucking vampire bats of South America.</p>

                <h2>Reproduction</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Gestation: 40 days - 6 months (bigger bats have longer gestation periods)</p>
                <p>Litter Size: Mostly one pup</p>
                <br>
                <p>For their size, bats are the slowest reproducing mammals on Earth. At birth, a pup weighs up to 
                    25 percent of its mother’s body weight, which is like a human mother giving birth to a 31 pound 
                    baby! Offspring typically are cared for in maternity colonies, where females congregate to bear 
                    and raise the young. Male bats do not help to raise the pups</p>
